This document outlines the key questions addressed in the analysis of an insurance company's claim data. The aim is to identify patterns and relationships between variables to provide actionable business insights.

1. Identify Categorical and Continuous Variables
Determine the variables in the dataset that are categorical (e.g., gender, region) and continuous (e.g., age, BMI, charges).
This classification sets the foundation for further analysis. <break>
2. Visualize Continuous Variables and Analyze Correlations
Create histograms to observe the distribution of continuous variables like age, BMI, and charges.
Use box plots to detect outliers and variability in these variables.
Perform a correlation analysis to identify relationships between continuous variables.
3.1 Male/Female Ratio and Gender-wise Smoking Habits
Analyze the male-to-female ratio in the dataset.
Identify which gender has a higher percentage of smokers.
3.2 Charges vs Age
Investigate the relationship between a customer’s age and their insurance charges.
Visualize trends using charts such as scatter plots or line graphs.
3.3 Charges vs BMI
Examine whether there is a connection between a customer’s BMI and their insurance charges.
Highlight any significant trends or thresholds.
3.4 Charges for Smokers vs Non-smokers
Compare the charges claimed by smokers and non-smokers.
Analyze the extent to which smoking influences insurance costs.
3.5 Region-wise Smokers vs Non-smokers Analysis
Conduct a regional analysis to identify the distribution of smokers and non-smokers across different regions.
Use pivot tables and visualizations to present the findings.
3.6 Region-wise Charges for Smokers vs Non-smokers
Analyze how charges differ for smokers and non-smokers across regions.
Provide insights into regional trends in insurance claims.
3.7 Charges vs Number of Dependents
Investigate the impact of the number of dependents on insurance charges.
Explore whether families with more dependents claim higher charges.
3.8 Dependents-Charges Analysis (Region-wise)
Perform a region-wise analysis of the relationship between the number of dependents and insurance charges.
Highlight regional variations in the influence of dependents on charges.
